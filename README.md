# Mudae-AutoBotludes $h command.
To use this bot just select one of the py files and run it after that u should click on the discord chat asap, and just wait for it to start typping.
When it's the first time of the day running the bot use the Escritor.py and run it, because they include the "daily", "rolls", "p", "dk" commands. 
If it's not the first time run the "Escritor de Manha.py" which is going to run the "$h" command.
(if u want to change to Waifu instead of Husbando just switch in the .txt files or if u want to add more commands just add them yourself in the .txt file)
